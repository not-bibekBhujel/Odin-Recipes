    <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
            Momos are a type of steamed filled dumpling in Tibetan and Nepali cuisine that is also popular in neighbouring Bhutan and India. Momos are usually served with a sauce known as achar influenced by the spices and herbs used within many South Asian cuisines. It can also be cooked as soup versions known as jhol momo where the broth is made from achar using a mixture of tomatoes, sesame seeds, chillies, cumin and coriander or mokthuk from boiling pork/buffalo bones mixed with various herbs and vegetables.

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>    
        <ul>
            <li>Minced meat</li>
            <li>grated onion</li>
            <li>Coriander</li>
            <li>Garlic paste</li>
            <li>turmeric powder</li>
            <li>Cumin powder</li>
            <li>Grated chillies</li>
            <li>vegetable oil</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>flour</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Add 1 grated onion to the minced meat.</li>
            <li>Add half a tablespoon of turmeric powder. This is to add a bit of color to the meat</li>
            <li>To enhance the flavor of the filling add 2 tablespoon of salt.</li>
            <li>Add 2 tablespoons of grated chilli. You can add a bit more if you want the momos to be spicy.</li>
            <li>Add 2 tablespoons of ginger and garlic paste each.</li>
            <li>Add half a tablespoon of coriander powder to make the filling taste a bit sour.
                Mix the spices with the meat.</li>
            <li>Add 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil and mix it again. The oil prevents the filling from getting too dry</li>
            <li>Put the flour into a bowl.</li>
            <li>dd water a little at a time to the flour to make dough.
                Knead the dough for a few more minutes. This makes the dough easier to use.</li>
            <li>Pinch off a bit of the dough,With a rolling pin roll the dough as thin as possible into circular shapes (don&quot;t make them too thin or too thick) the size of a glass. </li>
            <li>Put around one tablespoon of the filling into the centre of the wrapping.</li>
            <li>Pinch one edge of the wrapping to the other edge then twist it.</li>
            <li>Keep doing this until the filling is covered (make sure the wrapping fully covers the filling otherwise the momos may break when steamed).</li>
            <li>Oil the bottom of the steamer. This prevents the momos from sticking.</li>
            <li>Put the momos in a systematic order so that they don&quot;t touch each other.
                Steam for 20 &hyphen; 30 mins.</li>
        </ol>
